# CineMatch: A Movie Recommendation System Using Python & Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a simple **CineMatch System** built using **Python** and **Machine Learning**. It suggests movies based on what the user likes, using a method called **content-based filtering**.

---

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Suggests movies similar to the ones you like.
- **Easy to Use**:
  - Input your favorite movies and get recommendations instantly.
- **Uses Machine Learning**:
  - Built with popular Python libraries.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` - for numbers and calculations
  - `pandas` - for handling data
  - `scikit-learn` - for machine learning
  - `nltk` - for processing text
